                    <h2>A DAPP to safely split ETH and ETC</h2>

                    <p class="lead">
                    The hard fork in block 1920000 created two networks: The
                    forked chain (here referred to as ETH) and the classic chain
                    (here referred to as ETC). If you had ether in an account
                    before the hard fork, you now have this amount on both
                    chains. If you transfer 10 ETH from account A to account B,
                    then this same transaction can (usually) be replayed on the
                    other chain as well, and will there move 10 ETC from account
                    A to account B. You might not want that!
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead">
                    This DAPP provides a simple interface to create a
                    replay-safe transaction. It is a single transaction which is
                    valid on both chains, but has different effects on each one.
                    This allows you to move your ETH from account A to account B
                    and - at the same time - your ETC from account A to account
                    C. The DAPP charges 1 % on the ETC side for this service. So
                    you will receive 100 % of your ETH and 99 % of your ETC.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                        Step 1 (optional): Take a look at the
                        <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc8d9890df1ff2e87be05e9edab3cca26f054b611#code">verified source code</a>
                        of the splitter contract that will be used. It lives at
                        address
                        <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc8d9890df1ff2e87be05e9edab3cca26f054b611">0xc8d9...b611</a>.
                        The split method is the heart of the contract and you can see, that it will either route the
                        payment to the destination address for ETH or to the destination address for ETC.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Step 2: Create an account at <a href="https://poloniex.com/">Poloniex</a>
                        and go to Balances &gt; Deposits &amp; Withdrawals and request a new deposit
                        address for Ethereum Classic (ETC).
                        </lI>

                        <li>
                        Step 3: Open Mist or start Ethereum Wallet with the flag "--mode mist" and open
                        this page in the Mist browser. Open the account menu in the upper right corner
                        and select the account or accounts which you would like to make visible
                        to the DAPP.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Step 4: If you have this page open in Mist, you should see a form below which
                        allows you to prepare the transaction. Select the account from which you want
                        to send, pick an amount and enter destination addresses for ETH and ETC. Enter
                        your Poloniex deposit address for ETC and whatever address you like for ETH.
                        It is recommended to create a new ETH account for this purpose, but it is also
                        possible to simply send ETH back to the sender account.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Step 5: Click on "prepare transaction" and double-check the details. Then click
                        on "sign transaction" and enter your account password.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                        Step 6: Wait 5 to 10 minutes for Poloniex to recognize your deposit of ETC.
                        You are now ready to trade!

                        <li>
                        This DAPP is provided by me, Viktor Novak. I am also the author of
                        <a href="https://etherdice.io/">Etherdice</a>,
                        <a href="https://kissbtc.io/">kissBTC^E</a> and

                        <li>
                        Your transaction needs to be relayed to the ETC network to take
                        effect there. Currently this seems to automatically happen for
                        all transactions. If it should stop, it would be necessary
                        to manually relay it - I'm working on a convenient way to do that,
                        but for the moment it should not be necessary.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        The transaction can only be relayed if your accounts on both
                        chains are still sufficiently in sync. This should usually be the
                        case, but you might want to check on
                        <a href="http://etherscan.io/">Etherscan</a> and
                        <a href="http://gastracker.io/">GasTracker</a> (go directly
                        to gastracker.io/addr/&lt;your address here&gt; to see your balance
                        on the ETC chain).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        Note that Poloniex has a minimum deposit amount of 1 ETC and that
                        the DAPP takes a 1 % fee. So send at least something like 1.1 ETH/ETC
                        if you want to test it with a small amount.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        The destination address can be the same as the sender account. But
                        this will bring your balance on the two chains out of sync. Keep that
                        in mind if you want to send multiple transactions. For example: If you start
                        out with 100 ETH and 100 ETC and then send 1 ETH back to the account and 1 ETC
                        somewhere else, then the original account now has 100 ETH on the ETH chain
                        and 99 ETC on the ETC chain. If you now create a transaction which moves 100 ETH,
                        then it won't be possible to relay it on the ETC chain. So in this case the
                        second transaction can at most be for an amount of 99.
                        </li>
